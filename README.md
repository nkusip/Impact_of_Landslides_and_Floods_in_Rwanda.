# Topic: Impact of Landslide and Flooding Incidents in the Northern and Western parts of Rwanda over the last 5 Years.

## Questions:

• How have landslide and flooding incidents changed over the last five years in the northern and western parts of Rwanda?
• How many people have been affected (including details on deaths, injuries, and displacements) due to landslide and flooding incidents?
• How many infrastructures and crops have been affected (houses, schools, roads, cultivated areas, etc.)?

Rwanda has experienced increasing cases of landslides and floods due to climate change, deforestation, unfair topography, and population pressure. The most affected areas are the Western and Northern Provinces of Rwanda. Therefore, my capstone project will focus specifically on these regions.
To answer the above questions, I will collect data on landslide and flooding incidents reported over the past five years. I will also collect data on affected persons or households, displaced or relocated households, infrastructure damages, and, if available, the extent of affected crop areas.
I expect to have results showing the trend of landslide and flooding incidents over time; bar charts for categorical data; possibly a map; pie charts, etc.
